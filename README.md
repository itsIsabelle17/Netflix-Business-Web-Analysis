# Business, Web, and Marketing Analysis for Netflix

## About the Project
Netflix’s mission statement is “We want to entertain the world.” Netflix tries to attract customers to its service by providing access to best-in-class TV series, documentaries, feature films, and mobile games anywhere and anytime. Entertainment and Worldwide scale are primary points of Netflix’s mission statement. Netflix’s corporate vision is to be one of the leading companies of the OTT business era. The company focuses on continuing dominant leadership in OTT business, easy internet access, and entertainment.  
Netflix was the first and largest streaming service, generating approximately $30 billion annually. And the giant dominated the market for a while until other competitors like Disney+, Hulu, Amazon Prime, and others entered the market over the past few years. However, with the development of the OTT industry, Netflix has been in a fierce battle with its competitors, and it has lost subscribers after 10 years. In particular, the number of subscribers lost about 1.2 million in the first and second quarters of this year, and the stock price also fell by more than 70% from the peak in November 2021.  
This project aims to suggest a marketing strategy by analyzing Netflix's business model and the problems it is currently facing.

The expense structure was also examined to identify any issues.

### 4. Key Analysis   
* Traffic Analysis  
  News and articles report on Netflix's subscriber losses and stock price fluctuations, but exact numbers and specific changes are often unknown. To gain a comprehensive understanding of Netflix's overall performance and compare it to different periods, traffic analysis was conducted from 2017 to October 2022. Excel, Tableau, and Marketing Analytics tools were used to analyze traffic data and provide recommendations based on the findings. 
  * Visits and Unique Visits  
    * Analyzing visits and unique visits is vital for understanding website traffic and user engagement. It helps evaluate marketing effectiveness, identify popular content, and measure website growth. Insights into user behavior, such as visit frequency and duration, can be used to optimize content and improve the user experience for better conversions. 
    * Visits represent the total number of browsing sessions on a website, while unique visits indicate the number of distinct individuals visiting within a specific time period, regardless of visit frequency.
  * Pages per Visit  
    * Pages per visit is a web analytics metric that measures the average number of web pages viewed by a user or group of users during a single visit to a website. It provides an estimate of how much content a person engages within one browsing session.
  * Bounce Rate  
    * The bounce rate is a website analytics metric that indicates the percentage of visitors who leave a website after viewing just one page. Analyzing the bounce rate helps website owners identify areas of improvement to enhance user experience, increase engagement, and improve conversion rates.
  * Average Visit Duration  
    * Average Visit Time is a metric that provides an average estimate of the time users spend on a website during each visit. Analyzing this metric helps understand user engagement and evaluate the effectiveness of website content and design. 
  * Overall Results  
    * This is part of the summarization of the results of the overall traffic analysis over time, speculation about the reason, and all the contents of the recommendation to Netflix.

* SEO: Keyword Analysis
  Keyword research helps businesses identify the best keywords to target and understand customer search behavior. It informs marketing and content strategies by revealing query popularity and ranking difficulty. Targeting relevant searches can increase website traffic. For Netflix, we conducted keyword research including Volume, CPC, Competitive Density, Natural Search Results, and User Intent Analysis. We analyzed specific keywords over the past 12 months.
  * Volume Analysis 
    * Volume analysis is a key metric in SEO that examines the average monthly search volume for a specific keyword over a 12-month period. 
    * By analyzing search volume, Netflix can determine popular and competitive keywords to guide their marketing and content strategies. This allows them to target keywords that attract potential customers and drive traffic. Emphasizing high search volume keywords can optimize their marketing efforts.
  * CPC(USD) 
    * CPC (USD) analysis shows the average price (USD) an advertiser pays for a user clicks on an ad triggered by a specific keyword.
    * CPC is one of the most important metrics to measure and optimize to ensure a good return on a company’s investment. We looked at the top 20 keywords with the highest CPC and the top 20 keywords with the lowest CPC.
  * Competitive Density Analysis
    * Competitive Density measures competition among advertisers bidding on a keyword in PPC campaigns, ranging from 0 to 1. Higher scores indicate more competition and difficulty in standing out in search results. It helps businesses understand keyword competitiveness based on the number of advertisers bidding on it in pay-per-click advertising. 
  * Natural Search Result Analysis
    * The analysis reveals the number of URLs appearing in organic search results for a specific keyword. While paid advertising provides instant results, having a strong organic search strategy is crucial for long-term success. 
    * Organic search results offer a competitive advantage and can help businesses outperform competitors on search engines without relying solely on digital marketing strategies.
  * Intent Analysis
    * Understanding user intent is crucial for achieving high rankings in search engines. It is essential for businesses to identify the problem or need that searchers and potential customers have and address it effectively through content and marketing strategies. Examining the search engine results for a keyword can help determine the user's intent. We identified four types of user intent: Transactional, Commercial, Informational, and Navigational. 

### 5. Competitor Analysis (Disney+, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Apple TV, HBO Max)
* Comparison and analysis of annual revenue, subscribers, subscription cost, and each major strategy
* We compared and analyzed Disney Plus, Hulu, Amazon Prime, Apple TV Plus and HBO Max, which are Netflix's main competitors and OTT service giants.

### 6. Additional Business/Marketing Strategic Recommendations
* User Interface Design Recommendation 
  * To enhance user experience, Netflix needs to improve the user interface by adding a search bar and an intuitive search tab. In addition, it should incorporate various metrics to increase user engagement. By diversifying the business model with advertising areas, Netflix can leverage its strong brand presence to generate new revenue and attract partnerships.

* Contents Recommendation
  * To strengthen its position in the OTT business, Netflix should focus on diversifying its entertainment show offerings based on original content. By doing so, Netflix can attract more subscribers and compete effectively with OTT rivals like Disney Plus, who have successfully created diverse entertainment series from their original content.
